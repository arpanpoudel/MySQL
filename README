   1) Edit odbc_example.cpp
      DO:  more $HOME/.my.cnf to see your MySQL username and  password
      CHANGE:  MYUSERNAME  and   MYMYSQLPASSWORD  in the main function of
                the program to your username and mysql password 
   2) RUN: ./runpython.sh
      This installs the tables from the HW3 solution and does the inserts.
          - if you like your own hw3 solution, comment out or delete that line
            from runpython.sh
      Then runs the python program.
      The program has functions that are tested to do inserts, deletes, and updates of
      records from the HW3 tables.
